# Elasticsearch and Kibana configuration example

## About Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of
addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it
centrally stores your data for lightning fast search, fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, and
powerful analytics that scale with ease.

## About Kibana

Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your
Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack. Do anything from tracking
query load to understanding the way requests flow through your apps.
