# Welcome to the Qlico Documentation

Qlico is an open-source project designed to simplify running your web projects
inside Docker. At its core, it is a set of configuration files intended to

stack.

- **Customizable**: Use and extend your own configuration files effortlessly.
- **User-Friendly**: Maintains the default `docker compose` experience with

## Getting Started

To start using Qlico, please refer to the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md).

## History

Qlico began in 2017 as a side project to manage multiple Dockerfiles for various
PHP versions. Initially, all projects were mounted inside a single webserver,
leading to performance issues on macOS and difficulties in managing PHP versions
per project. To overcome these challenges, [Tom](https://github.com/TomKeur){:target="_blank"}
created a new, more efficient Docker stack, and Qlico was born.

## The Name Qlico

The name Qlico is derived from "Kliko," a term for plastic trash cans in the
Netherlands, symbolizing the use of "containers" in Docker/Kubernetes.

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and
> naming things."

## Qlico in Production

Qlico is suitable for both development and production environments. 
Use the `prod` stage of the `Dockerfile` for production deployment. 
Many companies successfully run Qlico in production within Kubernetes clusters.
